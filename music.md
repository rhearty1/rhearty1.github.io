# Music history

* 2002-2005: I played guitar in Town Pasture, a death metal/emo band in Marlboro, NJ, with Zack, Josh, Glenn, Mike, Corey and Andrew. Learned Sabicas from Michael Newman, Bach from Alice Artzt. Thanks goes to my parents, who drove me to lessons since I was twelve.
* 2005-2010: Went deeper into classical guitar world... with Ray, Julian, Manuel, Cengiz, Paul, Albert, Dave, Pat.
* 2010-2019: Not a whole lot happened (I needed to fix my guitar), a few notable exceptions with Lauren, Charlie, Jake.
* 2019-present: fixed my guitar!
