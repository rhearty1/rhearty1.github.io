## history

For Christmas 1999, my parents bought me a 1996 Ibanez Rx series stratocaster. Andrew gave me a Duncan humbucker, which made it sound awesome. It's now sitting on my repair bench. In high school, Zack, Josh, Glenn, Mike, Corey, Andrew and I formed Town Pasture, a death metal/emo band in Marlboro, NJ. We were influenced by some mixture of Metallica, Iron Maiden, Children of Bodom, and AFI. In 2001, my parents bought me another guitar, a cheap ($100) Yamaha classical, and I was enthralled. I learned Sabicas and Carlos Montoya from Michael Newman at Musician's Workshop in Freehold, then Bach and Villa-Lobos from Alice Artzt in Princeton. I can't stress enough that my parents supported me in this obscure obsession with guitar music. [Maureen](/assets/maureen.jpg) drove me to Freehold, studying for her bachelors in nursing while waiting in the car, while Jim took me to Princeton and spent the hour at Labyrinth Books.


In 2005, my obsession led me to Peabody, where I delved deeper into the classical guitar world thanks to my teachers, not only Ray Chester but also Julian Gray and Manuel Barrueco, and to my friends (Cengiz, Paul, Albert, Maud, Pat, Dave, Gohar, Tim, Lyle, and Artem). This was so much fun, and an interesting time to study music, even if many of us took different paths after graduating.


In 2010, I got a 9-5 job, then left in 2017 to pursue a PhD. Not a whole lot happened over those years since I needed to fix my guitar. I did a few memorable weddings and projects with Lauren and a few tunes with Charlie. In 2019, I fixed my guitar! Or, rather, the good folks at Old Town Lutherie did. Lately, I've been experimenting with DADGAD tuning in the style of Pierre Bensusan and Tom Long.
