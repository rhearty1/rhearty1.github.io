I enjoy all music, but especially the tune by David Wise from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qIk6YFTzckc" target="_blank">bramble scramble</a>.

## history

* 1999: Parents bought me a 1996 Ibanez Rx series stratocaster. Andrew gave me a Duncan humbucker, which made it sound awesome. It's now sitting on my repair bench.

* 2001-2005: We (Zack, Josh, Glenn, Mike, Corey and Andrew) formed Town Pasture, a death metal/emo band in Marlboro, NJ. We were the best in Mill Ponds, or so we thought. In 2001, my parents bought me a cheap ($100) Yamaha nylon string guitar, and I became obsessed. I learned Sabicas from Michael Newman at Musician's Workshop, then Bach from Alice Artzt in Princeton. My parents drove me to lessons for years: [Maureen](/assets/maureen.jpg) studied for her bachelors in nursing while waiting in the car, while Jim took me to Princeton and spent the hour at Labyrinth Books.

* 2005-2010: My obsession led me to Peabody, where I delved deeper into classical guitar world with Ray, Julian, Manuel, and friends (Cengiz, Paul, Albert, Dave, Pat, Tim, Lyle, Artem). This was so much fun, and an interesting time to study music, especially guitar. Some of us have stayed with it, others followed different trails.

* 2010-2019: I got a 9-6 job, then went to grad school. Not a whole lot happened since I needed to fix my guitar. I did a few memorable weddings and projects with Lauren and a few tunes with Charlie.

* 2019-present: I fixed my guitar! Or, rather, the good folks at Old Town Lutherie did.
