After the First Player's speech in Act 2 of Hamlet, one of my favorite speeches in Shakespeare (the performance by Charlton Heston is phenomenal), an exchange between Hamlet and Polonius reveals an interesting bit of Hamlet's moral fiber:<br /><br /><a href="" name="speech155"><b>HAMLET</b></a><span style="background-color: white;"></span><br /><blockquote><a href="" name="531">'Tis well: I'll have thee speak out the rest soon.</a><br /><a href="" name="532">Good my lord, will you see the players well</a><br /><a href="" name="533">bestowed? Do you hear, let them be well used; for</a><br /><a href="" name="534">they are the abstract and brief chronicles of the</a><br /><a href="" name="535">time: after your death you were better have a bad</a><br /><a href="" name="536">epitaph than their ill report while you live.</a></blockquote><a href="" name="speech156"><b>LORD POLONIUS</b></a><span style="background-color: white;"></span><blockquote><a href="" name="537">My lord, I will use them according to their desert.</a></blockquote><a href="" name="speech157"><b>HAMLET</b></a><span style="background-color: white;"></span><blockquote><a href="" name="538">God's bodykins, man, much better: use every man</a><br /><a href="" name="539">after his desert, and who should 'scape whipping?</a><br /><a href="" name="540">Use them after your own honour and dignity: the less</a><br /><a href="" name="541">they deserve, the more merit is in your bounty.</a><br /><a href="" name="542">Take them in.</a></blockquote><br />I'm convinced that Shakespeare's lines in total serve as a sort of treasure trove of 16th-century English culture. Hoping to study them closer in the ensuing months.<br /><blockquote>&nbsp;</blockquote>
