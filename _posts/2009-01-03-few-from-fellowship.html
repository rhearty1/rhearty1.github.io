1.  "Until he was 11, Galileo was educated privately at home, by his father and the occasional tutor.  Among his other talents, Galileo developed an aptitude for the lute (his father's favourite instrument) and reached professional standard; although he only played for amusement, the instrument remained a source of pleasure throughout his life." (Gribbin 26)<br /><br />2.  "The thing that looks particularly weird to modern eyes is that Bacon was trying to develop a method for doing science in a step-by-step approach that would lead even the humblest practitioner to the correct conclusions, with no need for geniuses or flashes of insight -- no room, in fact, for the imagination.  He made an analogy with the difficulty of drawing a straight line freehand, which required a steady hand and a real deal of practice, and drawing a straight line with the aid of a ruler, which anyone could do.  His method was to be to science what a ruler was to the drawing of straight lines, a mechanical aid to discovery, or an inductive engine." (78)<br /><br />3.  "[Newton] proposed the idea of employing specialists in different areas of scientific research of interest to the Society -- an important step away from the notion that all of science could be adequately comprehended by one man, an idea which essentially died with Hooke." (268)
