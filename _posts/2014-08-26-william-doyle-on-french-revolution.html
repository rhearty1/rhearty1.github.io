<div class="MsoNormal" style="font-size: 10pt; margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 12pt;">"This great drama [the French Revolution] transformed the whole meaning of political change, and the contemporary world would be inconceivable if it had not happened. . . . In other words it transformed men's outlook. The writers of the Enlightenment, so revered by the intelligentsia who made the Revolution, had always believed it could be done if men dared to seize control of their own destiny. The men of 1789 did so, in a rare moment of courage, altruism, and idealism which took away the breath of educated Europe. What they failed to see, as their inspirers had not foreseen, was that reason and good intentions were not enough by themselves to transform the lot of their fellow men. Mistakes would be made when the accumulated experience of generations was pushed aside as so much routine, prejudice, fanaticism, and superstition. The generation forced to live through the upheavals of the next twenty-six years paid the price. Already by 1802 a million French citizens lay dead; a million more would perish under Napoleon, and untold more abroad. How many millions more still had their lives ruined?&nbsp;<b><u>Inspiring and ennobling, the prospect of the French Revolution is also moving and appalling: in every sense a tragedy."</u></b></span></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="font-size: 10pt; margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 12pt;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; William Doyle,&nbsp;<u>The Oxford History of the French Revolution&nbsp;</u>1989</span></div>
