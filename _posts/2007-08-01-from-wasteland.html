IV. Death By Water<br /><br />Phlebas the Phoenician, a fortnight dead,<br />Forgot the cry of gulls, and the deep sea swell<br />And the profit and loss.<br /><br />A current under sea<br />Picked his bones in whispers.  As he rose and fell<br />He passed the stages of his age and youth<br />Entering the whirlpool.<br /><br />Gentile or Jew<br />O you who turn the wheel and look to windward,<br />Consider Phlebas, who was once handsome and tall as<br />you.
