1. Myth of Universality - there is, as far as we can tell, no universal language. Maybe at some point of the distant past there was, but today it's almost impossible.<div><br /></div><div>e.g. - Republic of Georgia, <i>mama </i>means <i>father </i>and <i>deda </i>means <i>mother</i>.  The ultimate nail in the coffin of the myth of universality.<br /><div><br /></div><div>2. Myth of simplicity - No language is harder or easier for its own speech community to learn.  A six-year-old in any culture has the same relative ability to master their language as any other.</div><div><br /></div><div>3. Myth of teleology - language does not move towards a goal, nor evolve, nor change at a steady rate.</div><div><br /></div><div>4. Myth of gradualism - language changes in fits and starts.  See the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Vowel_Shift">Great Vowel Shift</a>.</div></div>
