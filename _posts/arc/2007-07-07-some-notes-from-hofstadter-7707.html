“One could suggest, for instance, that reality is itself nothing but one very complicated formal system.<span style="font-size:0;"> </span>Its symbols do not move around on paper, but rather in a three-dimensional vacuum (space); they are the elementary particles of which everything is composed.<span style="font-size:0;"> </span>(Tacit assumption:<span style="font-size:0;"> </span>that there is an end to the descending chain of matter, so that the expression “elementary particles” makes sense.)<span style="font-size:0;"> </span>The “typographical rules” are the laws of physics, which tell how, given the positions and velocities of all particles at a given instant, to modify them, resulting in a new set of positions and velocities belonging to the “next” instant.<span style="font-size:0;"> </span>So the theorems of this grand formal system are the possible configurations of particles at different times in the history of the universe.<span style="font-size:0;"> </span>The sole axiom is (or perhaps was) the original configurations of all the particles at the ‘beginning of time.’<span style="font-size:0;"> </span>This is so grandiose a conception, however, that it has only the most theoretical interest; and besides. Quantum mechanics casts at least some doubt on even the theoretical worth of this idea.<span style="font-size:0;"> </span>Basically, we are asking if the universe operates deterministically, which is an open question.” – p. 54<br /><br />[If we are to take Tom Stoppard's <span style="font-style: italic;">Arcadia</span> as food for thought, it seems Thomasina was right by suggesting that the laws of Thermodynamics (even the combustion engine) repudiate this Newtonian species of Determinism. - ed. Summer 08]<br /><br />[Maxwell thought of this asymmetry as well - ed March '09]
