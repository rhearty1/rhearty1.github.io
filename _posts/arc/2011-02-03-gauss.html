In 1807 Gauss became<br />a professor at Gottingen University. When<br />planetoid Ceres was discovered on January 1st,<br />1801, Gauss was able to compute its orbit from<br />only a few observations. On December 31st of<br />the same year, Ceres showed up again, exactly<br />where Gauss had predicted. Gauss had used<br />”least-squares” prediction which is based on the<br />assumption that the observation errors were<br />normally distributed. Gauss invented modular<br />arithmetic in 1801, and in 1831 introduced the<br />term ”complex number”. Together with<br />Wilhelm Weber, Gauss constructed the<br />electromagnetic telegraph in 1834.</p>
