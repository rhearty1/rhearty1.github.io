<p dir="ltr">I just finished Of Mice and <u>Men</u>. Next is The Pearl, followed by Grapes of Wrath. Then I'll try to get through East of Eden.</p><p dir="ltr">&#8220;Boileau said that Kings, Gods, and Heroes only were fit subjects for literature. The writer can only write about what he admires. Present day kings aren&#8217;t very inspiring, the gods are on a vacation, and about the only heroes left are the scientists and the poor. . . . And since our race admires gallantry, the writer will deal with it where he finds it. He finds it in the struggling poor now.&#8221; &#8212;Steinbeck in a 1939 radio interview</p>
