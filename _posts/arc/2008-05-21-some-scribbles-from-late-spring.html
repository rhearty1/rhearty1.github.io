Putnam's slogan:  "Scientific realism is the only philosophy of science that does not make the success of science a miracle." (xxii)<br /><br />"What should be noted is that agnostic empiricism comes in two varieties:  naive and sophisticated.  The naive variety stresses that the only rational option is suspension of judgment as to the truth of theoretical assertions.  The sophisticated variety, associated with van Fraassen's approach, is that being agnostic is no less rational than being scientific realist." (Psillos xxi)
