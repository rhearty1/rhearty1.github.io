1.    "Each event spoke with a cryptic tongue.  And the moments of living slowly revealed their coded meanings.  There was the wonder I felt when I first saw a brace of mountainlike, spotted, black-and-white horses clopping down a dusty road through clouds of powdered clay.<br />  There was the delight I caught in seeing long straight rows of red and green vegetables stretching away in the sun to the bright horizon.<br />  There was the faint, cool kiss of sensuality when dew came on to my cheeks and shins as I ran down the wet green garden paths in the early morning.<br />  There was the vague sense of the infinite as I looked down upon the yellow, dreaming waters of the Mississippi River from the verdant bluffs of Natchez.<br />  There were the echoes of nostalgia I heard in the crying strings of wild geese winging south against a bleak, autumn sky.<br />  There was the tantalizing melancholy in the tingling scent of burning hickory wood.<br />  There was the teasing and impossible desire to imitate the petty pride of sparrows wallowing and flouncing in the red dust of country roads.<br />  There was the yearning for identification loosed in me by the sight of a solitary ant carrying a burden upon a mysterious journey.<br />  ...<br />  There was the incomprehensible secret embodied in a whitish toadstool hiding in the dark shade of a rotting log.<br />  ...<br />  There was the great joke that I felt God had played on cats and dogs by making them lap their milk and water with their tongues.<br />  ...<br />  There was the love I had for the mute regality of tall, moss-clad oaks.<br />  There was the hint of cosmic cruelty that I felt when I saw the curved timbers of a wodden shack that had been warped in the summer sun.<br />  ...<br />  And there was the quiet terror that suffused my senses when vast hazes of gold washed earthward from star-heavy skies on silent nights..." (Ch. 1)<br /><br />2.   "From the white landowners above him there had not been handed to him a chance to learn the meaning of loyalty, of sentiment, of tradition.  Joy was as unknown to him as was despair.  As a creature of the earth, he endured, hearty, whole, seemingly indestructible, with no regrets and no hope.  He asked easy, drawling questions about me, his other son, his wife, and he laughed, amused, when I informed him of their destinies.  I forgave him and pitied him as my eyes looked past him to the unpainted wooden shack.  From far beyond the horizons that bound this bleak plantation there had come to me through my living the knowledge that my father was a black peasant who had gone to the city seeking life, but who had failed in the city; a black peasant whose life had been hopelessly snarled in the city, and who had at last fled the city--that same city which had lifted me in its burning arms and borne me toward alien and undreamed-of shores of knowing." (end Ch. 1)<br /><br />3.    "The days and hours began to speak now with a clearer tongue.  Each experience had a sharp meaning of its own.<br />  There was the breathlessly anxious fun of chasing and catching flitting fireflies on drowsy summer nights.<br />  There was the drenching hospitality in the pervading smell of sweet magnolias.<br />  There was the aura of limitless freedom distilled from the rolling sweep of tall green grass swaying and glinting in the wind and sun.<br />  There was the feeling of impersonal plenty when I saw a bool of cotton whose cup had spilt over and straggled its white fleece toward the earth.<br />  There was the pitying chuckle that bubbled in my throat when I watched a fat duck waddle across the back yard.<br />  There was the suspense I felt when I heard the taut, sharp song of a yellow-black bee hovering nervously but patiently above a white rose.<br />  There was the drugged, sleepy feeling that came from sipping glasses of milk, drinking them slowly so that they would last a long time, and drinking enough for the first time in my life.<br />  ...<br />  There was the excitement of fishing in muddy country creeks with my grandpa on cloudy days.<br />  There was the fear and awe I felt when Grandpa took me to a sawmill to watch the giant whirring steel blades whine and scream as they bit into wet green logs.<br />  ...<br />  There was the dry hot summer morning when I scratched my bare arms on briers while picking blackberries and came home with my fingers and lips stained black with sweet berry juice.<br />  ...<br />  There was the morning when I thought I would fall dead from fear after I had stepped with my bare feet upon a bright little green garden snake.<br />  And there were the long, slow, drowsy days and nights of drizzling rain..." (Ch. 2)
