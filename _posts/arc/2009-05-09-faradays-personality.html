"Elspeth Crawford has sought to understand Faraday's creativity by studying his learning process.  As she rightly emphasizes, learning about nature was for Faraday a form of self-knowledge and one that led to a particular emotional state by which he could, through humility, free himself from prejudice and give rein to his curiosity and creative powers."
