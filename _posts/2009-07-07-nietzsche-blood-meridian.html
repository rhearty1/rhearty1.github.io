cf. to Judge Holden, "If war is not holy man is nothing but antic clay." p. 307<br /><br />cf. Heraclitus fragmenta:<br /><br />"War is both father and king of all; some he has shown forth as gods and others as men, some he has made slaves and others free." (53)<br /><br />"It should be understood that war is the common condition, that strife is justice, and that all things come to pass through the compulsion of strife." (80)<br /><br />From Zarathustra:<br /><br />I tell you: one must have chaos within oneself, to give birth to a dancing star. (Prologue, 5)<br /><br />I would only believe in a God that knows how to dance. (I.7)<br /><br />vs. the theme of dancing and the judge as a skilled dancer.<br /><br />From GM:<br /><br />Without cruelty there is no festival: thus the longest and most ancient part of human history teaches — and in punishment there is so much that is festive! (2.VI) [In this one the link to BM is especially appreciable.]<br /><br />That every will must consider every other will its equal [ie. Kant's categorical imperative] — would be a principle hostile to life, an agent of the dissolution and destruction of man, an attempt to assassinate the future of man, a sign of weariness, a secret path to nothingness. (2.XI)<br /><br />It is possible to imagine a society flushed with such a sense of power that it could afford to let its offenders go unpunished. (2.XI)
