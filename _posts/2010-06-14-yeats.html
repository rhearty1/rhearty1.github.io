No longer in Lethean foliage caught<br />Begin the preparation for your death<br />And from the fortieth winter by that thought<br />Test every work of intellect or faith,<br />And everything that your own hands have wrought,<br />And call those works extravagance of breath<br />That are not suited for such men as come<br />Proud, open-eyed and laughing to the tomb.
