We see some very public nightmares playing out in companies that have emerged from disciplines like computer science and electrical engineering. We don't have to go all the way and believe in a surveillance society to acknowledge that developments within these fields are dangerous and in need of rethinking.

In their very readable introduction to history of technology written for European engineering students, Erik van der Vleuten, Ruth Oldenziel, and Mila Davids point out that one of the fundamental lessons from history of engineering is that yesterday's dreams may become tomorrow's nightmares.[Give examples.]

We could see this coming. In 1989, David Billington wrote, in his opening lines to *The Tower and the Bridge* (1983):

> > While automation prospers, our roads, bridges, and urban civil works rot. Children control computers while adults weave between potholes. The higher that high technology sails the worse seem our earthbound services for water, transportation, and shelter. Yet civilization is civil works and insofar as these deteriorate so does society, our high technology not withstanding.

Yet against such warnings, engineering schools of the late 1980s and 1990s continued to follow futurist dreams and invest heavily in public-private partnerships that favored electrical engineering and computer sciences--the disciplines that I'll just refer to as "working with ICTs"--over civil engineering.
