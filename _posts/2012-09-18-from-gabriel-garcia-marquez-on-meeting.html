<div>When we asked him what he was reading, he sighed and mentioned a book on the economic wars of the future, author and title unknown to me.</div><div><br /></div><div>"Better to read 'Don Quixote,'" I said to him. "Everything's in there." Now, the 'Quixote' is a book that is not read nearly as much as is claimed, although very few will admit to not having read it. With two or three quotes, Clinton showed that he knew it very well indeed. Responding, he asked us what our favorite books were. Styron said his was "Huckleberry Finn."</div><div><br /></div><div>I would have said "Oedipus Rex," which has been my bed table book for the last 20 years, but I named "The Count of Monte Cristo," mainly for reasons of technique, which I had some trouble explaining.</div><div><br /></div><div>Clinton said his was the "Meditations of Marcus Aurelius," and Carlos Fuentes stuck loyally to "Absalom, Absalom," Faulkner's stellar novel, no question, although others would choose "Light in August" for purely personal reasons. Clinton, in homage to Faulkner, got to his feet and, pacing around the table, recited from memory Benji's monologue, the most thrilling passage, and perhaps the most hermetic, from "The Sound and the Fury."</div><div><br /></div><div>from&nbsp;<a href="http://www.3quarksdaily.com/3quarksdaily/2005/12/gabriel_garca_m.html">http://www.3quarksdaily.com/3quarksdaily/2005/12/gabriel_garca_m.html</a></div>
