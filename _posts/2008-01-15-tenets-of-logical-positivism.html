<span style="font-family:times new roman;">From Ladyman:</span><span style="font-family:'PrimaSans BT,Verdana,sans-serif';"><br /><br />1)  Science is the only intellectually respectable form of inquiry.<br />2)  All truths are either:  (a) analytic, a priori and necessary (tautological) or (b) synthetic, a posteriori and contingent.*<br />3)  So far as knowledge goes, it is either purely formal and analytic, such as math and logic, or it is a kind of empirical science.*<br />4)  The purpose of philosophy is to explicate the structure or logic of science.  Philosophy is really the epistemology of science and analyzing concepts.**<br />5)  Logic is to be used to express precisely the relationships between concepts.<br />6)  The <span style="font-style: italic;">verifiability criterion of meaning</span>:  a statement is literally meaningful if and only if it is either analytic or empirically verifiable.<br />7)  The <span style="font-style: italic;">Verification Principle</span>:  the meaning of a non-tautological statement is its method of verification; that is, the way in which it can be shown to be true by experience.<br /><br />* - Godel's Incompleteness Proof seems to undo these two tenets, or at least to obfuscate the analytic/synthetic distinction (in Mathematical Logic)<br />** - This seems to have failed.<br /></span>
