from "Imagination &amp; Perception" (in Foster and Swanson, <span style="font-style: italic;">Experience and Theory</span>. Massachusetts, 1970.)<br /><br />"Of course when you first see a new, an unfamiliar thing of a familiar kind, there is no question of past perceptions of <span style="font-style: italic;">that</span> thing being alive in the present perception.  Still, one might say, to take it, to see it, as a thing of that kind is implicitly to have the thought of other possible perceptions related to your actual perception as perceptions of the same object.  To see it as a dog, silent and stationary, is to see it as a possible mover and barker, even though you give yourself no actual images of it as moving and barking; though, again, you might do so if, say, you were particularly timid, if, as we say, your imagination was particularly active or particularly stimulated by the sight.  Again, as you continue to observe it, it is not just a dog, with such and such characteristics, but <span style="font-style: italic;">the</span> dog, the object of your recent observation, that you see, and see it as." p. 40-41.
