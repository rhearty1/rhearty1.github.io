My background is in engineering. I worked for six years at the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory before beginning work toward a PhD in history of science and technology. I study the recent history of engineering communities and pursue two long-term goals, or hopes: to encourage interaction between humanists, social scientists, and engineers, and to support engineering education reform that will enhance inclusion and equity.

I live in Columbia with Lauren and [Little Bear](/assets/little-bear.jpg).
