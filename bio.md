My background and training is mostly in the fields of engineering and history. Here's a short [cv](/assets/hearty-cv.pdf).

I worked for six years at the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory, mostly on NASA's Parker Solar Probe. In 2017, I began a PhD in history of science and technology. I'm  currently writing a disciplinary history of environmental engineering in the United States, focused on the 1960s to 1980s. I study history of science not only for its intrinsic value but also for its relevance to many of our most pressing problems. I think often about the Anthropocene. Through my teaching and research, I hope to encourage broad reflection upon our current practices by improving dialogue between engineering and the humanities, especially on problems of inequality and environment.

I live in Columbia, MD, with [Lauren](https://www.irismusicproject.com/team) and the [little bear](/assets/little-bear.jpg).
