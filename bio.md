My background and training is mostly in the fields of engineering and history.

I worked for six years at the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory before I began a PhD in history of science and technology at JHU, where I study the recent history of engineering communities. I'm working on a dissertation on the origins and development of environmental engineering in the United States.

Through my teaching and research, I hope to encourage interaction between existing disciplines, especially between engineering and the humanities, and especially on problems of inequality and the environment. I also support engineering education reforms that will enhance inclusion and equity. I think over-specialization and exclusion are the two [grandest](http://www.engineeringchallenges.org/challenges.aspx) challenges to engineering in the United States.

I live in Columbia, MD, with [Lauren](https://www.irismusicproject.com/) and our [little bear](/assets/little-bear.jpg).
