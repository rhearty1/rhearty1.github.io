My background and training is mostly in the fields of engineering and history.

I worked for six years at the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory before beginning work toward a PhD in history of science and technology at JHU, where I study the recent history of engineering communities.

I pursue two long-term goals, or hopes: to encourage interaction between existing disciplines, especially history and engineering; and to support engineering education reform that will enhance inclusion and equity. Over-specialization and exclusion are the two [grandest](http://www.engineeringchallenges.org/challenges.aspx) challenges to engineering in the United States.

I live in Columbia with Lauren and [Little Bear](/assets/little-bear.jpg).
