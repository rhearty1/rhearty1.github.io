My background and training is mostly in the fields of engineering and history.

I worked for six years at the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory before I began a PhD in history of science and technology at JHU, where I study the recent history of engineering communities. I'm writing a disciplinary history of environmental engineering in the United States.

Through my teaching and research, I hope to encourage interaction between existing disciplines, especially between engineering and the humanities, and especially on problems of inequality and the environment. To overcome the [grand engineering challenges](http://www.engineeringchallenges.org/challenges.aspx) of the 21st century, we will need to include and reflect upon all human knowledge, not just that of a particular disciplinary approach or subset of people. To get there requires new knowledge, yet the path toward that goal is uncertain.

I live in Columbia, MD, with [Lauren](https://www.irismusicproject.com/team) and the [little bear](/assets/little-bear.jpg).
