My background and training is mostly in the fields of engineering and history. Here is my [cv](/assets/hearty-cv.pdf).

I worked for six years at the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory, mostly on NASA's Parker Solar Probe, before I began a PhD in history of science and technology at JHU, where I study the recent history of engineering communities. I'm currently writing a disciplinary history of environmental engineering in the United States. I study history of science not only for its intrinsic value  but also for its relevance to many of our most pressing problems. Through my teaching and research, I hope to encourage broad reflection upon current engineering practice through improved interaction between engineering and the humanities, especially on the problems of inequality and  environment.

I live in Columbia, MD, with [Lauren](https://www.irismusicproject.com/team) and the [little bear](/assets/little-bear.jpg).
