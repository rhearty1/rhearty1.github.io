My background and training is mostly in the fields of engineering and history of science. Here's a short [cv](/assets/hearty-cv.pdf). I worked for six years at the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory, mostly on NASA's Parker Solar Probe. In 2017, I joined the PhD program in history of science, medicine, and technology at JHU. I'm currently writing a history of environmental engineering in the United States and how the field was sustained through major transformations in environmental knowledge, policy, and activism of the second half of the twentieth century.

I live in Columbia, MD, with [Lauren](https://www.irismusicproject.com/team) and the [little bear](/assets/little-bear.jpg).
