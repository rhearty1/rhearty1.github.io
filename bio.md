I worked as engineer for a variety of FAA and Navy projects from 2011 to 2013, then on Parker Solar Probe from 2014 to 2017. I began a PhD program in history of science and technology in 2017 to better understand the role of engineering and technology in the United States.

I live in Columbia, MD, with Lauren and Little Bear.
