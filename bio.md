My training is mostly in engineering and history of science. Here's a short [cv](/assets/hearty-cv.pdf). I worked for six years at the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory. Most of that time was spent working on NASA's Parker Solar Probe. My specialization was digital/wireless communications theory and signal processing, FPGA design, and digital hardware testing.

When my role on Solar Probe ended in 2017, I "switched careers" and joined the PhD program in history of science, medicine, and technology at Johns Hopkins University, where I've learned how to teach and research the history of engineering from a deep, humanistic perspective. My dissertation is a history of water quality management in the United States from the late 1940s to the early 1980s. I want to understand how this interdisciplinary field was sustained through major transformations in environmental knowledge, policy, and activism, and especially how it's been shaped by sanitary and environmental engineers.

My research is motivated by the late, great Ann Johnson and her call for a deeper understanding of the history of applied science. I'm also inspired by the work of engineering studies scholars, past and present. I help maintain the [Engineering Studies](https://www.chstm.org/content/engineering-studies-0) working group at the Consortium for History of Science, Technology, and Medicine in Philadelphia, and I'm a member of the [International Network for Engineering Studies](https://www.inesweb.org/)).

I live in Columbia, MD, with Lauren and [little bear](/assets/little-bear.jpg), and ride a 1982 Fuji Supreme.
