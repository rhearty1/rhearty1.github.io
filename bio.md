My research focuses on water pollution and the experts who have managed it since the late nineteenth century. As a PhD candidate in history of science and technology at Johns Hopkins University, my dissertation, _The Pollution Experts: Engineers, Biologists, and the Problem of Water Quality in Rivers of the United States, 1935 to 1975_, explores the science of river pollution in the United States over a period of striking developments in federal funding and regulations to address a growing crisis. Our current understanding and definition of “water quality,” I argue, came from simultaneously tense and productive communication between engineers and biologists over how to define, monitor, and model river pollution. Engineers, who held managerial authority in state, interstate, and federal water pollution agencies by the 1950s, had different tools, different goals and measurement objectives, and different ways of communicating their findings--all of which influenced the activities of biologists. Some biologists resisted, devising their own separate research programs. And yet, the need to collaborate one with another forced them to communicate, negotiate, and overcome conflicts and misunderstandings. Together, they formed our current understanding of “pollution,” enshrined in the opening sentence of the Clean Water Act of 1972, which referred to the “chemical, physical, and biological integrity of the Nation’s waters.” In the process, “sanitary” engineers became “environmental.”

My broader interest is to understand how and why communities of experts change. Before becoming an historian, I worked as engineer at the Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Laboratory, where I built radio hardware for NASA's Parker Solar Probe. My experience taught me to appreciate the promises and pitfalls of the engineering profession from the inside. Then I learned how to analyze engineering from the outside, from a humanistic perspective. To support the emerging, interdisciplinary field of engineering studies, I co-chair the [Engineering Studies](https://www.chstm.org/content/engineering-studies-0) working group at the Consortium for History of Science, Technology, and Medicine in Philadelphia.
