My current research explores the science and engineering of water pollution since the late nineteenth century. As a PhD candidate in history of science and technology at Johns Hopkins University, my dissertation, _The Pollution Experts: Engineers, Biologists, and the Problem of Water Quality in Rivers of the United States, 1935 to 1975_, analyzes the science of river pollution in the United States from the perspective of two groups—engineers and biologists—during a period of striking developments in federal funding and regulations to address a growing crisis. Our current understanding and definition of “water quality,” I argue, came from simultaneously tense and productive communication between engineers and biologists over how to define, monitor, and model river pollution. Engineers held managerial authority in state, interstate, and federal water pollution agencies by the 1950s while biologists remained marginalized in these agencies for most of the period. The two groups had different tools, different goals, and different ways of communicating their findings. Yet their need to collaborate with each other forced them to communicate, negotiate, and overcome conflicts and misunderstandings. Together, they formed our current understanding of “pollution,” enshrined in the opening sentence of the Clean Water Act of 1972, which referred to the “chemical, physical, and biological integrity of the Nation’s waters.” Experts learned from each other and, in the process, “sanitary” engineers became “environmental.”

Before becoming an historian, I worked as electrical engineer at the Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Laboratory, where I built radio hardware for NASA's Parker Solar Probe. My experience taught me to appreciate the promises and pitfalls of engineering practice from the inside. Then I learned how to analyze engineering from the outside, from a humanistic and historical perspective. To support the emerging, interdisciplinary field of engineering studies, I co-chair the [Engineering Studies](https://www.chstm.org/content/engineering-studies-0) working group at the Consortium for History of Science, Technology, and Medicine in Philadelphia.
