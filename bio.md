As an historian of science and technology, I am broadly interested in engineering projects over the last century, and especially how engineers have formed associations, collaborated, negotiated, and conflicted in their various projects. I am particularly interested in the relationship between engineering and other scientific disciplines, especially in managing water resources, as well as the relationship between engineering and regulation, especially environmental law.

As a PhD candidate in history of science and technology at Johns Hopkins University, my dissertation examines the science of river pollution in the United States from the 1930s to the 1970s, a period of striking developments in federal funding and regulations to address water pollution. I study the relationship between engineers and biologists within water pollution control, because I want to find out how and why they collaborated or conflicted on specific projects, in order to help my readers understand how engineers' authority as managers influenced knowledge production in this interdisciplinary field.

I co-chair the [Engineering Studies](https://www.chstm.org/content/engineering-studies-0) working group at the Consortium for History of Science, Technology, and Medicine in Philadelphia. Before pursuing graduate training in history of science, I served as an electrical engineer on NASA's Parker Solar Probe.
