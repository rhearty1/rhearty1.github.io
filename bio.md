I worked as engineer on a couple FAA and Navy projects from 2011 to 2013, then on the radio for Parker Solar Probe from 2014 to 2017. I began a PhD program in history of science and technology in 2017 to better understand engineering and technology in the United States.

I live in Columbia, MD, with Lauren and [Little Bear](/assets/little-bear.jpg).
