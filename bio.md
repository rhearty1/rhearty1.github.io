At Johns Hopkins University, I study past collaborations across disciplines and cultures in order to educate future engineering leaders. Scientists and engineers know that technology shapes society, but few appreciate how much society also shapes science and technology. My teaching focuses on professional cultures of engineering, communication, and ethics. My research explores how experts understood and managed water pollution in the United States since the late nineteenth century.

I received my PhD in History of Science and Technology at Johns Hopkins University in 2023. My dissertation, titled “The Pollution Experts: Engineers, Biologists, and the Problem of Water Quality in Rivers of the United States, 1935 to 1972,” analyzed the rise and development of water quality management, a multidisciplinary field of applied science, from the New Deal to the Clean Water Act. I wanted to elucidate the perspectives of two groups—engineers and biologists—during a period of striking developments in federal funding and regulations to address a growing crisis.

The definition of “water quality” that emerged during this period came from simultaneously tense and productive communication between engineers and biologists over how to define, monitor, and model river pollution. Engineers held managerial authority in state, interstate, and federal water pollution agencies by the 1950s, while biologists were relatively marginalized. The two groups had different tools, goals, and ways of communicating their findings. Yet their need to collaborate with each other forced them to negotiate and overcome misunderstandings throughout the 1960s. Together, they influenced legal definitions of “pollution,” enshrined in the opening sentence of the Clean Water Act of 1972, which referred to the “chemical, physical, and biological integrity of the Nation’s waters.”

Before re-training as an historian, I worked as an electrical engineer at the Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Laboratory, where I built radio hardware for NASA’s Parker Solar Probe. My experience taught me to appreciate some of the promise and limitations of engineering practice, from the inside. Then I learned how to analyze engineering more broadly from the outside, with humanistic and historical perspective. To support the multidisciplinary field of engineering studies, I co-chair a [working group](https://www.chstm.org/content/engineering-studies-0) at the Consortium for History of Science, Technology, and Medicine in Philadelphia.
