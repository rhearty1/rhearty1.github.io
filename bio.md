My research focuses on water pollution and the experts who have managed it since the late nineteenth century. As a PhD candidate in history of science and technology at Johns Hopkins University, my dissertation explores the science of river pollution in the United States from the 1930s to the 1970s, a period of striking developments in federal funding and regulations to address water pollution. I study the experts devoted to understanding and managing water pollution because I want to learn how their collaboration transformed the disciplines involved, in order to help my readers understand why expert perspectives and communication mattered, and still matter, for addressing problems of water quality that have persisted throughout the twentieth century and up to the present.

Before becoming an historian, I worked for seven years as engineer at the Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Laboratory, where I contributed hardware for NASA's Parker Solar Probe. My experience taught me to appreciate the promises and pitfalls of the engineering profession from the inside. Then I learned how to analyze engineering from the outside, from a humanistic perspective. To support the emerging, interdisciplinary field of engineering studies, I co-chair the [Engineering Studies](https://www.chstm.org/content/engineering-studies-0) working group at the Consortium for History of Science, Technology, and Medicine in Philadelphia.
