I'm mostly trained in engineering and history of science. Here's a [short cv](/assets/hearty-cv.pdf). I worked for six years at the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory, where I specialized in wireless communications, signal processing, FPGA design, and hardware testing. Our team built and tested the radio for NASA's Parker Solar Probe.

After completing my work on Solar Probe in 2017, I "switched careers" and joined the PhD program in history of science at Johns Hopkins University, where I've learned how to approach engineering from a historical, humanistic perspective. My dissertation is a history of water quality management in the United States from the 1940s to the early 1980s. I want to understand how this multidisciplinary field was sustained through major transformations in environmental knowledge, policy, and activism, and especially how it's been shaped by sanitary and environmental engineers.

My thinking, although shaped overall by the example of my incredible teachers and fellow graduate students, is particularly motivated by the late, great Ann Johnson and [her call](https://doi.org/10.1525/hsns.2008.38.4.610) for a deeper understanding of the history of applied science. I'm inspired by the work of many other engineering studies scholars, past and present. I help maintain the [Engineering Studies](https://www.chstm.org/content/engineering-studies-0) working group at the Consortium for History of Science, Technology, and Medicine in Philadelphia, and I'm a member of the [International Network for Engineering Studies](https://www.inesweb.org/)).

I live in Columbia, MD, with [Lauren](https://www.irismusicproject.com/musicians) and [little bear](/assets/little-bear.jpg). I haunt public libraries and ride a 1982 Fuji Supreme.
