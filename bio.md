My background and training is mostly in the fields of engineering and history of science. Here's a short [cv](/assets/hearty-cv.pdf). I worked for six years at the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory, mostly on NASA's Parker Solar Probe. In 2017, I began a PhD in history of science and technology, hoping to bring insights from humanities into engineering practice. I'm currently writing a disciplinary history of environmental engineering in the United States, focused on the 1960s to 1980s.

I live in Columbia, MD, with [Lauren](https://www.irismusicproject.com/team) and the [little bear](/assets/little-bear.jpg).
