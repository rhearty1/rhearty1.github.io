<b id="internal-source-marker_0.37538570910692215" style="font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 15px; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">I was once fully convinced of the idea of philosophy as a serious vocation. The "middle three" of my five undergraduate years were spent very well, learning as much as I could about the history of philosophy. This motivated me through my mathematics and science courses, and my intellectual vigor was at an all-time peak. I was really feeling quite strong, although physically I wasn't at all. It was a cerebral kind of strength, one perhaps most indebted to the Stoic philosophy I learned junior year. Then, when I was 22/23 (the fifth year), I had a crisis whereby philosophy no longer seemed to be a valuable or fruitful enterprise. And I did not make the naive, boring criticism that philosophy has never produced any actual science; what I realized is that the pursuit of a coherent philosophy leads to dead ends, or (even worse) lethargy. This came upon me on the last semester of my philosophy undergraduate program, when I took two classes: one on Plato's works, and one on the philosophy of law. Something about Dean Moyar's complexion, and (my old favorite) Richard Bett's blas√© liberal lifestyle (recall him headbanging to Tchaikovsky at the Meyerhoff) did not sit well with my 23-year-old mind, then tempered by the experiences of a mostly reclusive college career spent in the library, then about to embark into the world of science and engineering. &nbsp;So I decided to invest my time in the tried-and-true discipline of FPGAs and communications, landing a job with APL and feeling quite comfortable that I was able to finally start taking care of myself. This time of transition from philosophy to the more practical realm was complicated by my split with Lauren, which mostly took its toll on me by sapping my intellectual vigor, so that I was just barely able to pursue my studies in electrical engineering. (The proof of this collapse became clear every night, when I would return home to my closet in Artem's apartment and waste my time on YouTube or playing video games. This very well may have been the unhappiest year of my life.)</span><br /><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 15px; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">I have been pursuing engineering now for over 2 years, and I have begun to solidify a knowledge of communication systems and their DSP implementation. I'm beginning to feel quite happy with this choice, which will eventually give me some free time to renew my love for guitar (because I won't be taking so many damn classes trying to become an expert; hopefully I will have become one within a couple years of writing this). This also opens up the possibility of beginning to start back where I left off in philosophy, and learn more about what happened in the 21st century, after Nietzsche. In order to do this, I will need a constant stream of free-time, but I am beginning to feel inside the impetus to begin these pursuits again. In looking back at these years--from uninterested high school to super-motivated college to downtrodden Master's to cram-cram engineering knowledge APL employment and finally back to a well-balanced pursuit of all things heroic an idea which was forged in my heart at Hopkins) it appears that I am almost ready to become who I thought I would be at this point: a "Renaissance Man" relentlessly pursuing that great "golden mean" the Greeks called </span><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 15px; font-style: italic; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">arete</span><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 15px; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">, whereby I balance the greatest of all human pursuits: athletics, philosophy, music, friends and family, and work. I am beginning to feel the strength to get up early in the morning again.</span></b>
