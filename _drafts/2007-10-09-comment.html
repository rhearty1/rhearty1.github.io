The Epicureans hold that the universe consists of nothing but atoms and void, and they formulate a comprehensive physical theory based on this dichotomy.  Some aspects of their theory seem very plausible; others are flawed and open to question.  One such question is whether their atomic theory still stands given the possibility of an infinite number of worlds.  My paper will consist of two main thrusts against the Epicurean atomic theory:  first, that it assumes a materialist universe in order to prove the existence of a strictly material universe, and second, that it lacks a principle of uniformity that would justify its logical arguments for the existence of atoms and void.<br />Epicurean physical theory starts “first of all” with his three principles of conservation, which we will call x, y, and z.  These principles are:  (x) that “nothing comes into being out of what is not” (4A1); (y) that “it cannot be that all things are reduced to nothing” (4C4); and (z) that “the totality of things was always such as it is now, and will always be, since there is nothing into which it changes, and since beside the totality there is nothing which could pass into it and produce the change” (4A3-5).  The third principle is harder to grasp than the first two, until it is assumed that “change” is equated with “death” and, consequently, perishing (D, also 4 commentary).  One might then question whether the verity of z depends upon the verity of x and y:  only in a universe without “generation ex nihilo” (the contrary of x) and without perishing (the contrary of y) will the universe, or totality, subsist homogenously over time.  If so, are we to suppose that z is on par with x and y, or rather is z a fundamental of Epicurean physical theory based on the first two principles?  I view z as merely a necessary consequence of x and y, and so it should be one of Epicurus’ fundamental physical principles.  What he tries to establish with z, however, is the claim that anything that is discovered about the universe now will be true about the universe in the future.  With z, Epicurus can make broad claims about the composition of the universe:  claims such as the atom-void dichotomy.<br />Epicurus’ physical theory consists of several fundamental principles, four of which are necessary for my argument:  (a) “the totality of things is bodies and void” (5A1); (b) atoms are the “primary entities” of body (8A2); (c) atoms are theoretically divisible into finite, “minimum” magnitudes that are incapable of undergoing any further division (9A9); and (d) the universe is composed of an infinite number of atoms within an infinite expanse of void (10A3).<br />The question emerges of how Epicurus shifts from a view of the universe as consisting of bodies and void to a view of the universe consisting of atoms and void.  Epicurus states in his Letter to Herodotus that “the totality of things is bodies and void” (5A1); above, I called this principle a.  The existence of body is “universally witnessed by sensation itself, in accordance with which it is necessary to judge by reason that which is non-evident” (5A2, emphasis added).  It is obvious to an Epicurean that body exists, since we can see and feel body everywhere.  This must be true, according to the Epicureans, since “the preconception of true has its origin in the senses” and “the senses cannot be refuted” (16A3).  But when, from this evident truth, one tries to infer the universal existence of atoms, I believe justification is necessary.<br />The transition from bodies to atoms is accomplished by combining the above-mentioned truth a with the principle of conservation y.  For if we apply y to a, we will get the statement that “bodies cannot perish into nothing.”  From this newly constructed Epicurean truth emerges the notion of the atom as “uncuttable,” “incapable of dissolution” (8A2), “solid and uncompounded” (8B3).  For if one were to adopt a material view of the universe, as the Epicureans do, the only possible rendition of y is “no material substance can perish into complete non-existence.”  If, on the other hand, one were to adopt an immaterial view of the universe, as the Platonists do, then combining a and y would yield no new discovery; moreover, it is not clear whether they would even credit a as a true fundamental principle of his physics.  It is only after adopting a materialist outlook that this combination of a and y is enough to justify the inference of the atom-void dichotomy from the body-void dichotomy.<br />It must then be considered whether Epicurus assumes the existence of a material universe before launching his atomic theory.  The Platonist argument provides an alternative interpretation of the principles of conservation:  the universe consists of immaterial forms, and bodies exist insofar as they participate in and resemble these forms.  To infer the existence of atoms from principles x and y, Epicurus must, I believe, argue strictly on materialist grounds using a materialist proof.<br />The body-void dichotomy, and therefore the atom-void dichotomy, is flawed because of such materialist assumptions.  Lucretius constructs the proof for the body-void dichotomy in the following way.  (1) The existence of body is “declared by universal sensation itself” (5B2).  (2) If void did not exist, then “bodies would not have anywhere to be located, nor anywhere at all to move” (5B3).  (3) Nothing beyond body and void is distinct as a third substance (5B4).  (4) Anything that exists “will have to be in itself something with extension” for as long as it exists (5B5).  (5) If something is tangible, then it is body and has extension (5B6).  (6) If something is intangible, it will “be the emptiness which we call void” (5B7).<br />Lucretius’ proof assumes materialism in the following ways.  Step 2 reveals that the concepts of location and motion are necessary to the Epicurean concept of body; all body must have location and the capability of motion.  However, location and motion can only be thought of once space and matter are assumed to exist.  This indicates that there is a circularity ingrained within his proof.  Epicurus could not, I believe, define the terms “location” or “motion” without referring to body and void.  With step 3, Lucretius rules out the existence of immaterial substance, because, as Epicurus puts it, it “cannot be thought of” (5A4). In step 4, he attributes extension to every existing thing; here, it could be argued that immaterial substance exists but is not extended.  In steps 5 and 6 Lucretius defines body as tangible and void as intangible, thus outlining two extremes in which there are no intermediate degrees of tangibility and intangibility.  The materialist terminology he uses (“be located,” “anywhere to move,” “extension,” “tangibility,” and “intangible substance”) as support for the body-void theory is not convincing by itself because it assumes that the universe, at the microscopic level, is strictly material.  I believe Lucretius is actually pushing for a materialist view of the universe, for reasons that would be beyond the scope of this paper to question.  One such possibility, however, is that he is forging a physical system that would reinforce the messages of his ethical philosophy; it seems to me, at least, that a materialist view of the universe would do well to dissolve false notions of the gods and an afterlife.<br />Of major importance to my argument that Epicurus’ atom-void dichotomy is subject to scrutiny is the dependence of a’s validity on the principles of conservation x, y, and z.  As mentioned above, Epicurus gets from bodies—which are proved to exist by sensation—to atoms by combining a with y:  since nothing perishes into nothing, bodies cannot be infinitely divisible, so there must be an indivisible component of body—namely, the atom.  Atoms are the result of the combination only for a materialist such as Epicurus, for otherwise it may be argued (as a Platonist might) that the existence of body is subservient to the immutable forms.  An Epicurean might then say that it is only body that is evident from sensation, and so body must be held higher than anything that cannot be confirmed using sensation, such as the forms.  Nor do I think an Epicurean would accept Plato’s notion of forms in general, because it requires the soul’s immortality (an idea that Epicurus is opposed to in 24A).  If there were no prenatal existence, at which time these forms would become familiarized, then they would not exist, at least as a Platonist would see them.  In this way, Epicurus strengthens the atom-void dichotomy by ruling out an opposing view of generation ex nihilo.<br />As mentioned earlier, principle z is pivotal to Epicurus’ dichotomy; it is what substantiates his inductive claims.  If Epicurus believes “the totality of things was always such as it is now, and will always be,” then he seems to be postulating that a certain degree of uniformity exists in the universe.  Put another way, if sensation attests to the existence of bodies, then bodies exist indefinitely.  If it can then be inferred from bodies that atoms exist, in the way mentioned previously, then, using z, one could say that atoms exist indefinitely.  As I take it, principle z not only establishes this uniformity over time but also wants to establish uniformity in general.  This is precisely what Epicurus needs to launch his atomic theory; this would be the sort of “principle of uniformity” that is necessary, in my view, to prove the indefinite and universal existence of atoms and void.  I expound on this principle below.<br />To discuss the problems that arise with such a dependence on the principles of conservation, I will start with the logical format of the principles.  The modus tollens is used to form principles x and y in the following manner:<br />x:  Nothing comes into being out of what is not.<br />  p = things come into being out of nothing<br />  q = everything would come into being out of everything<br />  not-q = everything does NOT come into being out of everything<br />  not-p = x = nothing comes into being out of what is not<br />y:  Nothing perishes into what is not.<br />  p = things perished into nothing<br />  q = all things would perish<br />  not-q = things do not perish into nothing<br />  not-p = y = nothing perishes into what is not<br /><br />There is a jump here from p to q, which requires the assumption that all natural laws apply to all things in the same way.  For in order to construct this reasoning, it is unacceptable to think that some things are capable of generation ex nihilo while others are not (x), or that some things are capable of perishing into nothing while others are not (y).  There must be, therefore, an idea of uniformity throughout the universe.  But it is equivocal whether the Epicureans hold such an idea.  Principle z certainly resembles such an idea, in that it states that the totality of things is unchanging over time (4A4-5).  However, Epicurus himself believes in an infinite number of worlds, “both of those which are similar to this one and of those which are dissimilar” (13A).  Thus it first appears that they hold that there is no such uniformity in the universe, if we are to understand “dissimilar” to include things such as physical principles.  How is it that Epicurus can hold principles of conservation that apply to the totality while at the same time arguing that there are different worlds with different sets of principles?  His response to this question might allude to the fact that given (d) an infinite amount of atoms and a universe of infinite size through which these atoms move, there can indubitably be infinite configurations, and thus physical principles.  But as far as we are concerned in this corner of the universe, these principles of conservation stand.<br />Pressed further, Epicurus would have to explain his belief that the sensations of this world—which form the basis of the atom-void dichotomy–-would affirm the same results as in another world.  To reiterate, Epicurus needs a proof that some kind of uniformity exists throughout the universe.  In 5A2, Epicurus writes:  “That bodies exist is universally witnessed by sensation itself.”  This language seems to offer us some help in the current discussion; if he believes that sensation is universal, then whatever sensation tells us in this world could be affirmed in the infinite other worlds.  This does not, as I see it, amount to anything resembling a proof, since although he may be free to talk of infinitely many other worlds, he cannot, in this single world, know anything about the universal role of sensation.  Therefore, lacking sufficient evidence of a principle of uniformity (which could also be called a principle of universal sensation), Epicurus is not entitled to modus tollens reasoning.  His atomic theory falls apart in this minute respect.<br />  The problem of uniformity within the universe is only partly addressed by principle z, though it is not enough to clear up the physical inconsistencies that result from applying modus tollens reasoning to the physical world.  Although logically incontrovertible, the modus tollens falls apart because the physical constituents of p and q lack a principle of uniformity.  With the inclusion of the possibility of an infinite number of worlds, z cannot insure that the modes of representation in each world are identical.  Therefore, without a principle of uniformity, Epicurus cannot posit the atom-void dichotomy that is based upon the principles of conservation.  It is unclear, however, whether a proof for such a principle is even attainable.
