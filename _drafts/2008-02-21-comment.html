Implication<br />   def. 1 - A sentence S1 implies sentence S2 iff its schema M1 implies schema M2.<br />   def. 2 - A schema M1 implies schema M2 iff every time M1 is true, M2 is true also.<br /><br />Equivalence<br />   def. 1 - Two sentences are equivalent iff their schemas are equivalent.<br />   def. 2 - Two schemas are equivalent iff whatever assignments of truth values to one schema that gives the schema a certain truth value (T or F) gives the other schema the same truth value.<br />   --> Two schemas are equivalent iff they have the same truth table.<br />   Theorem - Two schemas are equivalent iff they imply one another (both directions of implication are met, so to speak).<br />   --> All tautologies are equivalent to each other; all contradictions are equivalent to each other.<br /><br />Theorem - Schema M1 is equivalent to M2 iff M1≡M2 is a tautology.<br />       Schema M1 implies Schema M2 iff M1⊃M2 is a tautology.<br /> <br />Consistency<br />   def. 1 - A sentence is consistent iff its schema is consistent.<br />   def. 2 - A schema is consistent iff it comes out true for at least one assignment of truth values to letters p, q, etc.
