Below is perhaps my shoddiest paper written to date.  The Topic:  the Stoic version of the teleological argument for God's existence.<br /><br /><br />The Stoics present a unique conception of god that they attempt to support through various arguments.  One such argument they use to secure their god as a designer of the universe is the teleological argument.  While I believe that this argument has ample room for objection, I will argue that the Stoics have a means to refute most of these arguments by referring to preconception as a criterion of truth.  While this supports the teleological argument, I also claim that it does nothing to secure any alternative Stoic description of god’s nature—leaving god’s nature virtually indeterminate.  First, I will try to outline the Stoic notion of god, and then I will present their teleological argument.<br />The Stoics see god as the active principle of the cosmos, in contrast with the passive principle:  unqualified matter (44B).  God is “that which acts” while matter is “that which is acted upon”, with action constituting a necessary criterion for existence in Stoicism (LS p.270).  Together, god and matter make up the only two principles of Stoic physics, or the only entities that exist “ungenerated and indestructible” (44B).  The active-passive dichotomy is enough for the Stoics to answer questions about the real constituents of the world, about causality, and about the metaphysical foundation for the qualities of existing things.  But this definition alone is insufficient to form an adequate idea of the nature of the Stoic god; the other names attributed to him represent his truly unique nature.<br />To justify the claim that god is the active principle—“that which acts”—the Stoics are forced into the assertion that god is a body (44B, 45G, 46H).  Stoic doctrine requires that if god is to have a strict causal effect on the world, he must have some bodily component.  The notion of god as a body fits well with another explanation of his nature—that is, as “designing fire” or “breath” (46A).  Fire and breath pervade unqualified matter through-and-through to give matter its essential properties (47H).  By linking god with fire and breath, perhaps the Stoics are trying to offer concrete, physical explanations of how the active-passive dichotomy works in the universe.  With the names “active principle” and “designing fire”, the Stoic god begins to appear as a veritable designer of the universe.<br />By pervading all matter as designing fire or breath, god must be in every part of the world.  Thus god is, in a way, the world (44F).  God pervades the world, according to the Stoics, much like the soul pervades a human individual—and through this analogy he takes the form of a rational designer (46F2, 53X).  As the whole, god also assumes the names of the entire Greek pantheon (54A).  Lastly, god is associated with causation or fate (46B, 55E); if he is the source of causation, he must be all-powerful.  We now have a deeper understanding of god’s unique nature as expressed by the Stoics:  an immanent, pervasive, all-powerful and rational designer of the universe.  In what follows, I will analyze their argument for why god must be a designer, though I will hold to my earlier claim that this argument in no way secures their unique description of god as an immanent and causal “designing fire”.<br />To secure this notion of god as a designer, the Stoics form a teleological argument that relies upon the strength of both (a) an analogy between man-made artifacts and the universe and (b) an induction that attaches a specific property of artifacts to the universe:  namely, its formation by a rational designer.  A summary of (a) is as follows.  A man-made artifact has a certain set of distinct properties, namely X.  A naturally existing object has another set of distinct properties, namely Y.  A major premise of any teleological argument, which we see in the Stoic argument, is that X and Y are in fact analogous.  That is, the properties of an artifact—such as its intricacy, uniformity, beauty, etc.—are taken to be the same properties we see in the natural objects of the universe.  Since the sets X and Y in both artifacts and the universe (or its constituent objects) are taken to be the same, the analogy wants to form the conclusion that artifacts and the universe are, in fact, analogous.  A principle such as “like effects have like causes” is needed for such a move.  And this is where (b) comes in to complete the teleological argument:  if artifacts and the universe have X and Y in common, then we can infer that artifacts and the universe share one more similar property:  they are both formed by a rational designer.  This property is by definition an attribute of all artifacts, but through (a) and (b) it is inferred to belong to the universe as well.<br />A problem with (a) is that it does not set out to prove, through scientific rigor, the strict similarity between properties X of artifacts and properties Y of the universe.  It is because of this assumed similarity that the universe is claimed to be designed by induction; that is, without the analogy, the induction would not be justified.  I take one property of X and Y as an example: complexity.  The complexity involved in creating the armillary sphere is perceived as similar to the complexity involved in “creating” the planets; therefore, complexity is allowed to go over in the analogy as it belongs to both X and Y in the same way.  I believe, however, that this is somewhat of an illicit assumption.  We cannot assume, with the force of argument, that the complexity in artifacts is similar enough to be analogous to the complexity in the universe.  Here, the Stoics are relying on the principle “like effects have like causes”.  The complexity of the universe (effect 1) resembles the design-complexity of an artifact (effect 2), and therefore the cause of the artifact’s design (a rational human being) resembles the cause of the universe’s design (something rational, namely god).  With this principle, the analogy may appear to have enough force to say that the design-complexity of the sphere resembles the design-complexity of the universe.  From here, the fact that the universe is designed is inferred.  It seems to me, however, that while the complexity of a man-made artifact can be traced to certain processes that we can grasp—for instance, carving wood into spheres, balancing different weights, bending metal ribbons into rings—the processes that account for the complexity of the universe are ultimately beyond our grasp (for we do not know how the perfectly spherical symmetry of a soap bubble could be designed).  So it seems to follow that artifacts and the universe have complexity in vastly different ways.  The Epicureans, in promoting their particular cosmology, touched on the fact that knowledge of this process of universal design is beyond human capabilities:  “What were the building techniques, the tools, the levers, the machines, the labourers, for such an enterprise?” (13G2).  The principle then fails because the effects are not “like” each other.  Thus, while the similarity between X and Y might be obvious in a common-sense sort of way, it is simply too weak to be used in arguments or proofs for god’s existence that would imply certainty.<br />As a Stoic reply to this argument against (a), they might refer to the notion of a preconception.  According to Diogenes Laertes, Chrysippus gave preconceptions the status of a criterion of truth (40A3).  It is therefore implied, by definition, that preconceptions are capable of supplying us with real knowledge of the world or “what is” (40A1).  The same notion is used by Balbus in 54C:  “For all have it inborn and virtually engraved in their minds that there are gods”. If the Stoics believe that preconceptions are formed from what is, then any preconception will have the force of truth.  This would enable them to justify not only the analogy in (a) between artifacts and the universe, but also the induction (b) that forms the conclusion of the teleological argument:  that the universe was designed by a god.  The idea that (a) and (b) really do apply is so innate in us, they would say, that it must be a preconception.  As a criterion of truth it is true, and therefore god exists as a designer.  But it might be worth questioning how, if it is so innate and universally agreed upon, the Epicureans were able to deny teleology and form their own unique notion of the gods.<br />Granting preconception the status of a criterion of truth, (b) still presents a problem.  The induction attaches the notion of “design” to the universe because it is a property of artifacts.  One might argue that since induction relies on the repeated occurrence of a given phenomenon or impression, we simply have not had enough repeated experience with the vast universe during our brief existence on Earth to adequately distinguish these design-like properties.  The induction would fail on the grounds that it is not nearly as probable that the universe was designed as it is probable that an artifact was designed—if our notion of “design” is taken to be derived from repeated experience with the products of craftsmen, artists, and the like.  The Stoics, however, would not need the force of probability on their side to form the conclusion that the universe is designed if they insisted on the strength of preconception (or even the cognitive impression, which may have room to come in here).  The induction is consistent with the preconception that the universe was designed, since “the mere sight” of objects of the universe with properties Y is “proof enough that they are not products of accident” (54C).  In addition, a Stoic might argue that in order for a preconception to be formed in the first place, it would have already met the criteria of probability to become a virtually certain cognition.  The Stoics seem to say that the universal objects with design properties bear a certain mark, and “produce an even movement in the soul” (39G).  When a conception becomes a preconception and therefore a criterion of truth, its verity can be assumed by the mark it carries.  And to think of the revolutionary spheres or other phenomenal objects as having design-like properties is a thought that bears such a mark.<br />By bringing preconceptions to their defense, the Stoics in fact strengthen their teleological argument.  But even if a preconception, as a criterion of truth, could substantiate their teleological argument, it is not at all evident from the outcome of this argument that the Stoic’s entire cosmological system is in turn justified.  Their unique notion of god is not the precise outcome of the teleological argument, but only that the universe is designed by some rational being.  It also seems intuitively necessary—especially in an analogy from man-made artifacts to the universe—that the designer of the universe would be an external designer, giving shape to matter from the outside.  This directly opposes the Stoic conception of god as immanent.  They Stoics may need an argument that allows for the self-creation or self-design of god—how they expect to justify this unique nature would require other, more powerful and likely more precise arguments that may not allow for the referral to a criterion of truth.
