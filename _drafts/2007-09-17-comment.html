In the nineteenth century, a paragon emerged from the banks of the Rhine who suddenly altered the aesthetic mindset of Europe.  This man bore the torch of the Romantics and, through his own musical creations, gave both aristocrat and commoner alike the means to shred the veil of worldly reality and peer into a deeper existence---even if only for a single moment.  Theodor W. Adorno, in his Music, Language, and Composition, believed that this man, Beethoven, was capable of creating music that transcends the realm of language---with its meanings and symbols---and becomes an unspeakable, indeterminable entity.  With this quality in music put aside, however, music cannot escape the resemblance it intrinsically has with language as a sort of system; it is logical, structural, conceptual, and, most of all, meaningful.<br />   Music is, according to Adorno, "a means of cognition that is veiled both for itself and for the knowing subject" (405).  This definition emphasizes the ambiguous face of music; whereas music can easily subsume the role of language--complete with structure, grammar, and an inferred meaning or image--it is not sufficient to call it a language.  The tones that make up a musical creation are enshrouded in ambiguity.  Yet it is not enough to stop here and say that music is a deficient language when it fails to create images.  In fact, it is when music completely frees itself from the shackles of language as a logical construction of symbols that it sees its most transcendent moment; it arrests the individual in a state of awe.  The subject begins to notice something profound, something primordial in the creation, at that moment when music no longer forces an incentive or a program, such as in the stile rappresentativo.<br />   It is the responsibility of the performer to see the dialectic that exists here.  Following Adorno, who writes that "everywhere music is shot through with intentions," it is not to be understood that music is always a "signifying language" (402).  Music ultimately strives for expression as an "intension-less language," passively speaking the primordial language of a transcendent reality.  The feeling of oneness and wholeness which may be felt through the reading of Christian scriptures or the attendance of mass is now to be extracted from the musical experience.  To control the emergence of this feeling, to temper the deep capabilities of sound, and to handle such a profound force as that which brings an individual so close to the universe as a whole, are all within the powers of the composer and performer as the expressers of music.
