This summer I watched all 3 seasons, this time with special attention to details (i.e. the time that was put into devising the script).  Below is a catalog of some of the quotes I found especially well-devised, most of which contained words or usages of words I've never heard before.<br /><br />Merrick:  We come to know the truth of our actions only in the protractions of time.<br /><br />Commissioner:  Yankton's interests force imposition on Bullock's privacy.<br /><br />Cy:  He's losin' his belly for the grift.  I'd had said they offered 100.<br /><br />Cy: From the clouds or in some type conveyance?<br /><br />Alma:  I was raised believing <span class="match">dereliction </span>of duty is the one sure way to happiness.<br /><br />Al (to Merrick):  The main <span class="match">dereliction </span>is Farnumâ€™s whose bailiwick specifically is new arrivals, but you have also been fucking remiss.<br /><br />Elsworth:  That's liable to bring the dromedary to its knees.<br /><br />Leon:  And thank you for that rasher of shit.<br /><br />Al:  You do recall you're only the transaction's beard.<br /><br />Al:  Yankton, exactly.  They're too busy stealin' to study human nature.<br /><br />Alma:  Though if you cannot forbear from patronizing me, I'd prefer if you didn't come at all.<br /><br />Langrishe:  Where is your lair, that I may beard you?<br /><br />Langrishe:  It's the learnin' nothin' that keeps me young.<br /><br />Wolcott:  What if the earth talks to us to get us to arrange its amusements?<br /><br />Al:  Goes through her men like Sherman to the fuckin' sea.<br /><br />Hearst:  A vulgar man would ask before preceding any further if you would require him to produce his jackknife and make himself a capon before you.<br /><br />Con:  You are lethally fuckin' middled.<br /><br />Merrick:  I can only answer perhaps, Mr. Hearst. Events have not yet disclosed to me all that I am.<br /><br />Langrishe:  I wish to state, unequivocally with this imposing gentleman as witness, I have no gossamer filament of doubt you have skills to delight and amaze.<br /><br />Al:  It's horrible bein' shot at. Never gets no better.<br /><br />Commissioner:  Men of a certain caliber cannot allow fastidious morality to distract them from the exigencies of commerce, can they, Mr. Hearst?<br /><br />Hearst:  The fool husband ought soon appear.  Some small number to deal with his dudgeon, main force in reserve for Bullock.<br /><br />Alma: In any case, please accede to my walking to the bank alone.<br /><br />Al (about Bullock):  Reason ain't his long suit.
