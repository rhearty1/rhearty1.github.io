from Seung:<br /><br />"I dare to propose a new way to unravel this thematic tangle.  This is to focus on the work's existential overtone [featured predominantly in the songs:  The Seven Seals, The Other Dancing Song, The Convalescent, On the Great Longing, etc.] and read it as a poem that features Zarathustra as a tragic hero" not in the sense that the work should be regarded as a tragedy, but (like Goethe's <font style="font-style: italic;">Faust</font><font>) as an epic poem.<br /></font>
