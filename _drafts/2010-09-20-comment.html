More on this soon, but right now I'll jot down two quick points:<br /><br />1.  No one nowadays wakes up, grabs a scroll of papyrus of a few theorems, and journeys down to the beach where they can draw out demonstrations in the sand using a twig.  It's just not done, but that's the way you gotta work through the Elements...<br /><br />2.  Euclid was most likely a compiler.  He couldn't possibly have thought of all those proofs by himself.  And the only reason there were so many proofs to compile is that <span style="font-style: italic;">the Greeks did not have a good number system with which to do arithmetic</span>.  So geometry was all they had.  Give me just a single tool and in my lifetime I will do all the things that are possible with that tool.  Give me two, perhaps:  a straight edge and compass.  That group of Greek mathematicians is perhaps the only lot that came close to doing everything possible given their particular tool set.  Take today's world of computers, VLSI, and MATLAB.  We haven't even come close to the possibilities of these tools, and we never will because, within 20 years, there will be yet newer tools.
