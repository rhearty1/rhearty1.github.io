After showing some friends music by either Stravinsky or Copland, I've heard things such as "this sounds like Looney Tunes" or "this seems like it would be part of a movie soundtrack."  To make matters worse, I've also heard fellow conservatory musicians say that Copland is cheesy.  The correct way to deal with and interpret these comments has flummoxed me for... going on a year now.  But I think I've figured it out.<br /><br />To use one of Rynasiewicz's old phrases, it's that these guys "don't have a historical bone in their body" (or, if they do, it somehow doesn't apply to music).  Copland must be listened to as the first great American composer; before him there was no Rodeo, and it was he who compiled traditional American melodies and introduced them to the concert venue.  His sound was unique in 1920-1940 because of his ability to mix traditional American elements with some of the avant garde European techniques in vogue at the time, as well as some of his own unique idioms.<br /><br />But he has since been copied by countless composers.  If your historical compass were not oriented correctly, you might mistake his music as trite, unoriginal, boring.  It is important not to see that which is near as primary and that which is historically prior (and thus removed) in the context of the near.  Rather, one must take a deterministic view of history in the sense that what is near is most likely reworked old material from the past and, if your best historical searches for precedents fail, only then you might consider the near as truly original work.  Once you have realized that what you are listening to had no precedent at the time, then you really start to appreciate the creativity of Copland and Stravinsky, and they can be given their due respect.<br /><br />[Question for the week: How can one not have a historical compass and expect to make informed claims?  This is especially heinous when the material that would give you such a compass is sitting under your very nose, as it is in most universities.]
