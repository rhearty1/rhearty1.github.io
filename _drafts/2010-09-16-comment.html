The workings of the human body never cease to amaze me.  Three weeks ago I got two long and not so inconsequential splinters lodged deep in my leg from a wooden and dessicated Hopkins bench overdue for a shellac.  Preoccupied with thoughts of tetanus, gangrene and lockjaw (my worry-wart nature I inherited from my nurse mother), I sought to remove these two rogues from my corpus, first by squeezing the obtruding heads (to no avail), then later that night by carving them out with a pocketknife, which accomplished nothing but to leave my skin raw and quaggy around the wound.  I capitulated by 8 o'clock, contemplating the absurdity of my concern, and left the tiny ligneous lances to the mercy of my killer T cells.<br /><br />Walking from the ECE lounge tonight after grabbing some scrap paper I involuntarily reached down to scratch the two scabs that had formed a whole three weeks ago, without ebbing the slightest; one had been scratched off.  I (again involuntarily) pushed down on the skin around it, and could see a trace of the head of my old wooden foe.  Pushing more, this little guy popped right out, coated with a gooey lubricant.  I was amazed, and decided to pluck off the scab of the other, which had dug itself thick into the hole of my skin carved deeper from pocketknife than splinter, and I saw that it had formed an adhesive glob around the head allowing for the rogue's quick and sudden removal.  This was a plan I thought too ingenious to be mindless.  The teleology of it all is startling.<br /><br />This was a gruesome post but, believe me, the moment was vivifying.
