if we hold that human life has meaning then two things follow:<br /><br />(1) this meaning must be understood to contain a moral component; it would mean that we must take the concept of morality seriously.  (If human life has meaning, nihilism must be false)<br />(2) certain treatment of humans would be patently immoral, for reasons that do not have to do solely with the pain which such treatment causes.<br /><br />Additionally, we could abstract away from the human point of view to see something intrinsically wrong with this type of treatment to all forms of life.  It would require the inclusion of the following:<br /><br />(3) Actions are immoral because of the type of action they are, and do not have anything to do with humans in particular.<br /><br />also,<br /><br />(4) Against certain traditional beliefs, there is no clear boundary separating humans from the rest of the animal kingdom.  All living things exist on a continuum of life evolving from perhaps a singular event, and the implications of this for moral distinctions between human treatment versus non-human treatment is seriously underestimated and underdeveloped.<br /><br />...<br /><br />Therefore, the naive argument in the defense of factory farming (under which the treatment, if it were of humans, would be patently immoral) would not work for anyone who thought that human life had meaning.  For an argument would claim that the continuum of life <font style="font-style: italic;">implies</font> that if <font style="font-style: italic;">human</font> life had meaning, all life had meaning.<br /><br />So it seems that one cannot claim that human life has meaning and that ...<br /><br />if it is held, on the other hand, that human life does <font style="font-style: italic;">not</font> have meaning, this puts us, our lives, and our existence, even closer to the realm of sows and sponges since this further cuts down antiquated boundaries which the continuum of life thesis would want to cut down once and for all.<br /><br /><br /><br /><input id="gwProxy" type="hidden"><!--Session data--><input onclick="jsCall();" id="jsProxy" type="hidden"><div id="refHTML"></div>
